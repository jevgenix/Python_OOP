Programming is designing and implementing software. The functionality is implemented based on the wishes and requirements of the users and the customers. Programs are typically implemented (i.e., written or "coded") in a programming language meant to be written and read by humans.

There are hundreds of programming languages out there, and this course focuses one of them. The language used in this course is Java, which is one of the most commonly-used programming languages in the world. Learning Java also makes it easier to pick up other programming languages.

Programming languages, such as Java, have many commands built-in that a programmer uses when developing software. This makes programming easier as you don't need to implement everything from scratch. For example, programming languages typically have built-in options available for different menus and views used for making graphical user interfaces. Indeed, a large part of programming is making use of available functions and tools in solving problems â€” this, however, requires programming experience, which you only gain by programming.
